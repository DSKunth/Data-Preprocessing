# Wrangle and Analyze Data
Data Wrangling is the process of gathering data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assessing its quality and structure, and cleaning it before performing further tasks like analysis, visualization, or build predictive models using machine learning.
In this project, the student is tasked to wrangle the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as [WeRateDogs®](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations by using Python and its libraries.
